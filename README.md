Mike woke up one day on a bench in the middle of nowhere, all he had with him was his 'simplegun'

and his basic armor

and all he had to do to escape was survive as many wave as possible to collect as enough cash for him to buy his freedom

## Scaries (Enemies)

|![SkeweringStalker](https://github.com/zegLine/gameProgCts5/assets/69742605/2e547b22-288b-4589-b937-64373d4904c4)|Altough he comes in later waves, his shots are not late as he tracks you around the map and pumps you full of lead|
